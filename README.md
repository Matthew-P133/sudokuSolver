# sudokuSolver
Console-based sudoku puzzle w/ auto-solve feature. Written in Java.

## Description

A simple text-based sudoku puzzle game and solver implemented in Java. The user is prompted to fill in the grid and have their solution validated. Or they can 'cheat' and have the computer do it instead: in this case, a recursive backtracking algorithm is used to find the solution to the given sudoku. 

## Notes

1. Strictly, a valid sudoku has only one solution; this program will also solve a 'sudoku' with more than one soltuion but will only provide one solution.
2. To change the sudoku simply comment, uncomment, and/or edit the test cases as appropriate.
